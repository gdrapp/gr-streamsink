Thanks to Daniel NÃ¶then, his code from butt (broadcast using this tool)
helped me out. http://butt.sourceforge.net/


Dependencies
------------
The LAME library (libmp3lame-dev) must be installed and you need a
SHOUTcast or Icecast server running.


Installation
------------
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig


Usage
-----
The block is available in grc (gnuradio-companion). See the examples
directory for some flow graphs and python applications.

Usage in python:
Import:
    import streamsink

Create the sink block:
    sink = streamsink.streamsink(
            samplerate,         # The input samplerate
            bitrate,            # The mp3 bitrate
            server_type,        # "shoutcast" or "icecast"
            address,            # IP address or hostname of the server
            port,
            password,
            icecast_user,       # Only required if using Icecast
            icecast_mountpoint) # Only required if using Icecast

Add additional info and properties for the SHOUTcast / Icecast stream
    sink.set_stream_public(False)
    sink.set_stream_name("Your stream name")
    sink.set_stream_genre("Your genre")
    sink.set_stream_url("example.org")
    sink.set_stream_description("Your description") # Only for Icecast
